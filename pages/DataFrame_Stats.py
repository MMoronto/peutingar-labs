   "If you want to build a wealthy economy, you must first start by building roads". 
   I don't recall exactly when I first heard this quote. It is an old Chinese saying, but then again, I can't be so sure. 
   This quote resonates when you consider fast-growing nations in the last century. 
   Much of their accomplishments were possible due to effective transportation infrastructure. 
   Road and rail networks are essential for opening up a country's interior.

   Roads foster cohesion across regions thereby facilitating trade and commerce amongst neighbors. 
   Roads are accelerants for developing manufacturing and industrial capacity in a region.''')
